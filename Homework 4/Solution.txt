In the question, it was clearly mentioned that while having multiple players in the ChessTournament, they are supposed
to be tracked and compared after each action is taken. While having multiple classes as followed: "Players", "ChessTournament"
and finally "ComparePlayers", the full system structure was maintained successfully. By using a Priority Queue, the ChessTournament
class is taking care of whom to add, move, and modify within the queue. A special random value generator function was also included
in the class in order to generate random point values for the players, regarding which the final and the further points are gained.

Not to mention, the whole flow is going to finish as soon as any of the players reach the 10 games in total. The loop is going to break
causing a final result in the terminal as was shared in the Output.png in the same directory. While printing the final results to the terminal,
as was asked, it is going to print the players and their according scores in a descending order, in other words, from the highest to the lowest.

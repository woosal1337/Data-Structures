In order to solve this problem, I have created a base class, so I can easily use it to inherit 2 new classes: "GradCourses" & "UnderGradCourses"
accordingly. While integrating a simple logging system in the background, so the user can also keep the track of each action happening by the 
program in the background, for the case of "GradCourses", which is a special case, and required an additional argument of underGradQuota besides the
UnderGradCourses class. As a result, on top of the arguments taken from the base "CourseRegistration" class, a brand new argument was requested by the
user, so this case would also be possible to be consider in the conditional function statements.

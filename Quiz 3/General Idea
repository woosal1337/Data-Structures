The nodes and their actions were already described in the given java file. Changes were made in order to set the according
conditions:

    1) Change the first element with the last
    2) Change the first element with the second
    3) Change the second element with the first (Takes the case back to the first)

The general idea standing behind the 1st and the 2nd conditions are the same, replace the first value with the second,
however, the order is different. As in the swapElements function 3 conditions were met according to the node change input,
there should be no error faced regarding to the logic and the idea standing behind the code.

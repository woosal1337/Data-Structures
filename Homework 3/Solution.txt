Considering the given is not really complex, however, quite detailed, it did take some time to include all these tiny details within
the same class. 

To begin with, all the requirements were met within the code, such as all the appropriate class names, Double-ended Queue, which is
actually tracking the customers and their arrival time to the restaurant. If the customer was served, it gets deattached from the 
current queue and is being added to a new list called as ServedCustomers. However, even though the customer was served, but was not
happy with their current table, they are added to the top of the queue back again. There was an "if" statement added where a randomly
generated time was checked within this condition, and if the generated waiting time for the given customer surpasses the given time,
which is 30 minutes exactly, then that customer is going to leave the restaurant while being logged.

DoublyLinkedList was implemented within the class and was included in the RestaurantWaitList class. TestRestaurant class was created,
and includes the details to test the given test partion. 

A custom name list was grabbed from GitHub in order not to leave the customer names empty in the list. 

As the restaurant is working only between 3 and 10, a custom time calculation functions are also included within the class, whereas,
the hours are converted to the minutes also, and they are each seperatly also checked with the conditions in order to check whether
the restaurant is closed or not with less than 3 or greater than 10 conditions. Each of the taken actions one-by-one are logged into
the system, so does not matter what the action is, it will always be logged.

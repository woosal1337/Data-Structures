In this question, we are asked to create 2 different classes, one representing a new class, which
is supposed to generate random 15 grades for the given 15 students, and do it while being written
in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) way. And another class, in the first class, as array was used
in order to keep the track of each student, and their grades. In the second part, the array will be
replaced by a Doubly Linked List while keeping the general idea and the logic the same.

A custom Linkedin List was used to be integrated with the DoublyCourseGrades class.
All the functions and the classes have been created and assigned accordingly.
